# CookingMaster-SaladChefSim
A repository for the salad chef simulator game created by Austen Kinney within 7 days to test their abilities.


####After Thoughts:

After completing the core game of "Super Salad Savant" the salad chef Sim game there are a number of things I would have done given more time to work on the project:

  1. Simplify Large Classes and Break them up into Single-Responsibility Classes. (e.g. CheckoutStation.cs, CarrierController.cs, WinScreenController.cs)
  2. Add In-Game Tutorial Prompts for Players to learn the game more easily while playing
  3. Add SFX to the UI Elements for when they are moused over
  4. Add Cancelling Actions
  5. Add Player Colors to Table Areas to Denote Owner
  6. Animated Text Elements (Title, Flashing Text, Bouncing Text, etc.)
  7. Text showing score changes above a players head
  8. Add an animated loading screen icon
  9. Add Unique SFX for Picking up and putting down plates
  10. Display the HighScores on the About Page
  11. Add looping tutorial clips to the How To Play page
  12. Add Animation for customers approaching the customer counter before placing an order
  13. Add More Player Characters
  14. Add Wider Variety of Customers
  15. Add A Wider Variety of Vegetables
  16. Add A Stage Select Sceen
  17. Add New Power-Ups
  18. Add Unlockable Characters, Stages, and Power-Ups
  19. Simplify Code Again for Readability and Optimization
