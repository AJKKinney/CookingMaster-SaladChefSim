# CookingMaster-SaladChefSim
A repository for the salad chef simulator game created by Austen Kinney for the Tentworks Interactive interview process.

After Thoughts:

After completing the core game of "Super Salad Savant" the salad chef Sim game there are a number of things I would have done given more time to work on the project:

  1. Simplify Large Classes and Break them up into Single-Responsibility Classes. (e.g. CheckoutStation.cs, CarrierController.cs, WinScreenController.cs)
  2. Add In-Game Tutorial Prompts for Players to learn the game more easily while playing
  3. Add SFX to the UI Elements for when they are moused over
  4. Animated Text Elements (Title, Flashing Text, Bouncing Text, etc.)
  5. Text showing score changes above a players head
  6. Add an animated loading screen icon
  7. Add Unique SFX for Picking up and putting down plates
  8. Display the HighScores on the About Page
  9. Add looping tutorial clips to the How To Play page
  10. Add Animation for customers approaching the customer counter before placing an order
  11. Add More Player Characters
  12. Add Wider Variety of Customers
  13. Add A Wider Variety of Vegetables
  14. Add A Stage Select Sceen
  15. Add New Power-Ups
  16. Add Unlockable Characters, Stages, and Power-Ups
  17. Simplify Code Again for Readability and Optimization
